**Please note that this program does not offer rewards for bug submissions as JamieWeb is just a small personal project.**

This disclosure program is limited to assets in the scope found at the bottom of this page.

# Things To Look For
* Web application vulnerabilities (Command Injection, SSRF, CSRF, XSS, etc)
* Security misconfigurations
* Suggested security improvements
* Information leakage
* Multi-byte exploitation
* Tor Hidden Service de-anonymization
* Security header configurations
* Content Security Policy (CSP) bypass

Feel free to use automated tools however not aggressively. If you wrote the tool/script yourself, aggressive tools are acceptable as long as you do not overly degrade the service or cause issues for other organisations, such as hosting providers, network operators or ISPs.

# Disclosure Policy
* Let me know of any potential vulnerabilities as soon as possible and I will make every effort to resolve the issue quickly.
* Share with me the full details of any vulnerability including steps to reproduce if applicable.
* Provide me a reasonable amount of time to fix the issue before disclosure to the public or a third-party.
* Try to avoid degradation of service, destruction of data or privacy violations.

I will make every effort to abide by HackerOne's disclosure guidelines: https://hackerone.com/disclosure-guidelines

# Exclusions
While researching, please do not attempt the following:
* Denial of service (DoS)
* Spamming
* Phishing
* Spoofing or hijacking
* Man in the Middle (MiTM) or interception
* Attacks which require physical presence on the network of a user
* Domain name hijacking or theft
* Account hijacking or theft
* Cybersquatting
* Social engineering
* Physical/real-life attacks
* Anything that could falsely lower the reputation of me or my website
* Anything that could falsely get me in trouble
* Attacks on 3rd-party systems that are out of my general control

# Rewards

Please note that this program does not provide monetary rewards for bug submissions.

Researchers who submit non-issues, false issues or purely opinion-based issues may not be thanked publicly.
